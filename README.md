# onhover-popover

This small HTML code features a compact implementation of a hover-activated popover. It includes a heading and a popover that shows the message "Hello! I'm a popover" when the user hovers over the text "Hover over me." The design is styled using an external CSS file, allowing for quick adjustments and customization. The popover includes an arrow to visually indicate its position, enhancing user interaction.
